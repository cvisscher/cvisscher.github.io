## Here is a secondary heading

One of the most remarkable "everday" confirmations of Einstein's theory of relativity (both special relativity and general relativity) are the corrections needed for GPS satellites to maintain their accuracy.  '

$$d  = c \times t$$

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
