Interconverting and displaying mathematical expressions between markdown, latex, and html is relatively straightforward using tools such as pandoc.  [This page](http://deeplearningthesis.com/jekyll/mathematics/programming/2018/01/14/setting-up-jekyll.html) has very useful instructions for converting and displaying mathematical expressions on-the-fly (that is, from Markdown to the properly rendered html) when using the jekyll template on github pages.

For a given page (such as this post) mathjax is implemented by setting **math: true** at the beginning of the page, for example:

title: Markdown Math on GitHub

tags: [math,web]
math: true

~~~

This allows us to use latex-style syntax to create equations, such as:

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

$$ E = mc^2 $$
