A writeup of some our recent work on "ultrahot Jupiters" can be found in this NASA JPL [press release](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7211) These are extremely hot giant planets that orbit very close to their host stars, so that molecules break apart on their dayside but cool to form clouds on their nightside. This research provides clues about the behavior and (non)detection of water on these planets.
