_Science and Religion: Perspectives Across Disciplines_ interweaves science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields with the arts, humanities, theology, and psychology to cultivate discussion on science and religion alongside biblical interpretation. This anthology is paradoxically ecumenical, for it embraces unifying and disparate positions without being prescriptive or exclusive. It is both synergistic and disruptive. Building on this premise, the Advent and Easter stories are examined through praxes from STEM, theology, and psychology. Taken together, this anthology allows for connection between disciplines by creating community in the midst of differing approaches to the study of science and religion.
