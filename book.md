_Science and Religion: Perspectives Across Disciplines_ interweaves science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields with the arts, humanities, theology, and psychology to cultivate discussion on science and religion alongside biblical interpretation. This anthology is paradoxically ecumenical, for it embraces unifying and disparate positions without being prescriptive or exclusive. It is both synergistic and disruptive. Building on this premise, the Advent and Easter stories are examined through praxes from STEM, theology, and psychology. Taken together, this anthology allows for connection between disciplines by creating community in the midst of differing approaches to the study of science and religion.

#### Reviews

"This tour de force of an edited volume brings together the best experts from across the disciplines to understand the science and faith interface. It is innovative, readable, and even practical. Editors May and Visscher alongside their chapter authors reveal the importance of ontological unity and epistemological plurality for bridging the disciplinary divide towards the deepest understanding of the science and faith interface."

-- **Elaine Howard Ecklund,** Rice University

"This is an engaging and timely book from both well-established scholars in science and religion and from new and impressive voices as well. It highlights the diversity of approaches required to address some of the most pressing issues facing us today and that drawing on many different disciplines across the sciences and humanities is needed to unify our increasingly fragmented world."

-- **Michael Burdett**, University of Nottingham

"Insisting on the importance of building intellectual communities across the dividing lines that so often separate scholars from one another, Science and Religion: Perspectives Across Disciplines admirably performs the disciplinary diversity and epistemological pluralism for which its editors and contributors call. The resulting eclectic collection of essays promises to feed both the academic study of science and religion, and the human imagination, in vitally important ways."

-- **Pete Jordan**, Scholarship and Christianity in Oxford (SCIO)
