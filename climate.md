*What factors influence global temperature anomalies?*

A link to an interactive climate model is [available here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nvsj0deiva). This simple model considers four main forcing agents:

* k<sub>s</sub>: variations in the total solar irradiance (TSI)
* k<sub>e</sub>: The El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
* k<sub>v</sub>: stratospheric aersol optical depth from volcanic eruptions
* k<sub>a</sub>: anthropogenic forcing, including well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHG) and land-use changes

Also shown are three temperature records for comparison:

* [Berkely Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/data/) Land+Ocean time series
* Hadley-CRU global temperature model
* NASA GISSTemp global temperature model
