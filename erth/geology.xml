            <abstract>
                <p>A general introduction to the physical nature and structure of the solid Earth, including, briefly, its physical geography and a more detailed look at its geology. The environmental implications of these subjects are detailed. Three lectures and one laboratory period of three hours per week plus one overnight field trip and one or two shorter trips. <em>These pages represent supplemental lecture notes for the slides and textbook material used in the course.</em></p>
