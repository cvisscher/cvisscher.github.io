            <abstract>
                <p>This course provides a general introduction to meteorology and weather. Climate and climate change in Quaternary times to the present are also considered. The implications of an anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse effect will be addressed, with particular attention given to the impact of these changes on the structure and function of ecosystems. May include one or two field trips to relevant sites in the region. <em>These pages represent supplemental lecture notes for the slides and textbook material used in the course.</em></p>
